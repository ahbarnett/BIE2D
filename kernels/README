Laplace, Stokes direct summation kernels, and global close-eval quadratures.
The latter are built on the Cauchy close evaluation: Cau_closeglobal.m

cauchycompeval_lsc2d.m : legacy method from LSC2D paper; superceded by
                         Cau_closeglobal.m

Includes 2nd deriv of SLP due to Jun Wang.

srcsum, srcsum2 : helper routines for periodicity.
