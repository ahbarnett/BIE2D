Release a simple maintainable BIE 2D Nystrom library to the world.
        
      Design notes, Alex Barnett 10/2/19.

low-level (w/ SIMD accel for kernel eval, suggesting C/C++).
      Keep really simple:
      C or C++ w/ structs, no objects.
      or: fortran up to f90, no modules.

plus high-level py wrappers to each of these, only for driving, plotting, demos.
(not matlab, or at least not immediately, since less professional).
But the low-level should contain everything mathematical, and be self-sufficient
so ppl can build lib on top of it.
Why not py for whole thing? since the fortran/C crowd need to call it - it
needs to be a low-level library which compiles on a bare-bones unix system.

Choices:

Panel format: like ytri, an array of structs containing nodes, weights,
      info about if abutts a corner. User-set p (based on log10(1/eps)).
      Lagrange interp from nodes.
      Also, flag giving type: 'panel' vs 'closed curve' (latter handle by PTR,
      bringing in BIE2D / pyBIE2D but recode in C).

      basic geom routines that tell you which panels have a target in their
      near field; return the sparse matrix of which panels are in each others
      near fields.

      Routines to adaptively split or merge panels based on geom, and on the
      near-field of other panels. Routine to read from TriWild, or file with
      list of panel nodes in it (or MADMAX point format).

Kernels: SIMD vectorized n-to-m direct apply (to charges), and matrix filler,
      for Laplace, Helmholtz, Stokes. Use fancy SIMD'ed 1/sqrt, etc.
      (save OpenMP for higher-level loops, eg to fill different mat blocks).

Quadrature: use 3-nei-panel to 1-panel auxiliary nodes for smooth + log.smooth,
      like Bremer. These can be from gen. Gauss. quad. (precomputed tables).
      Using all those auxiliary nodes will be fast since use good direct kernel.
      Why not Helsing, QBX, etc?: GGQ handles any kernel w/o having to do the
      analytic split. Allows same code to work w/ mod Helm, axisymm, etc.
      Still gets you say 1e-11, but not 1e-14.
      Speed of everything about the same in 2D anyway.

Input format: read various curve inputs or analytic formulae to spit out
      list of panels.

Close-eval: plain per-target adaptive for now, since works for every kernel,
      and fast if coded in C (not many targets are very close).
      Also, fill A_{I,J} block from panel to set of targets, could be on-surf
      or self.

Corners: allow up to general multi-junction of curved panels, done via either
      plain dyadic refinement (more a tutorial option)
      or, Rachh-Serkh (in prog.) - nodes for range of powers handles curves.
      or, RCIP (see Helsing, Shidong).

Utils: wrapper calling fortran FMM2D for relevant kernel, basic utils like
      GMRES, bary Lagrange, quad nodes, etc. Ie, self-contained except for FMM.
      Should not depend on another git repo of utils.

Other criteria: makefile should be able to compile all-low-level tests, indep
      of high-level lang interface.

Demos: dense direct solver, iterative solver w/ FMM, fast direct w/ some FDS
      linked if installed. Read from external geom.

Required packaged: GCC or a compiler; FMMLIB2D.
Optional packages: python (matplotlib, etc); some FDS.

Tutorials: could be py demos


Team: loosely, I'm making this up:
Libin
Alex (can't start until Nov 3...)
Manas
Mike ?
David S ?
consult: Leslie, Travis, Anil (re FDS), ...


To do / discussion pts ----------------

* commit to language, eg C/py or C++/py.

* talk to Anil re his C++ rskel solver mat el input format.

* understand py accessing C/C++ structs.

* understand Manas switching off of FMM direct, set subtraction w/ special quad.
(not urgent; can subtract off nearby plain pt FMM for now).

* check can apply D' on-surf ok.
