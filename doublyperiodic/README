Figure-generating codes for 2D doubly-periodic Laplace and Stokes (DLPS) BVPs
solved by boundary integral equations.

Please run ../bie2dsetup.m to configure the MATLAB path before running any
of the below.

There are six stable driver codes:

fig_lapQconv.m           : Laplace empty BVP convergence (Fig 2.1 ab)
fig_lapconvK1.m          : periodic Laplace BVP soln & flux conv (Fig 2.2 ace)
fig_stoQconv.m           : convergence of Laplace empty BVP solver (Fig 2.1 c)
fig_stoconvK1.m          : periodic Stokes BVP soln & flux conv (Fig 4.1 ac)
tbl_discarray_effcond.m  : square disc array Laplace conductivity, including
                           comparing against Helsing's solution (Table 3.1)
tbl_discarray_drag.m     : square disc array Stokes permeability (Table 4.1)

The fig_* codes are very quick to run (<1 to a couple of seconds).
The tbl_* codes take around 10-20 seconds.

To create EPS figures, make a figs/ directory and uncomment the figure
printing commands in the fig_* drivers above.

The code helsingeffcond.m is a slightly changed version of demo14b.m by Johan
Helsing (available on his website).

There are also other experimental codes.
