# BIE2D: MATLAB tools for boundary integral equations in 2D

This set of codes solves piecewise constant linear PDEs using boundary integral equations. It includes Laplace, Helmholtz, Stokes, log-singular self-evaluations, and close-evaluation quadratures based on the Cauchy kernel. Also are included periodic BVP solvers. It is somewhat tutorial in nature, and could be used as a template for faster Fortran/C versions.


Code mostly by Alex Barnett, based on work from 2008-2016.

Also includes code by L Nick Trefethen, Gary Marple, Bowei Wu.
